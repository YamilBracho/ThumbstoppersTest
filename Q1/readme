To run any of the those examples 
    - Download the directory to any folder in your PC
    - Open main01.html or main02.html in your browser
    
 - First approach
     this sample mixes UI and processing code in UI. Just check that the decisions are done
     in the loop where options are shown. A realyy bad decision because you are mixing things

- Second approach 
      The processing code is done where ite belongs, the javascript part.
